 
# we get 8 bytes of data
# starting from byte 3, we get the buttons a user is pressing
# if all bytes are zero, user has released all buttons

# 11 and the thumb top button seem to be special, and get represented in the first byte
# for some reason they can be pressed at the same time
# 
# - thumb top (0x4) and 11 (0x2) = 6

# this makes a total of 8 buttons that a user can press simultaniously

# [6, 0, 4, 22, 7, 9, 44, 21])
